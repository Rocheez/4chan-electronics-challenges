# 4chan-electronics-challenges
My submissions to a list of electronics challenges I found on 4chan.

Instead of post IDs, you can use a [random number generator](https://www.random.org/). Or just choose a project catches your interest and matches your skill.

**Please be safe when handling high-voltage projects!**

Due to the large variation in skill levels and materials required for each project, do not be afraid to reroll. This list is mostly meant for inspiration so don't feel obligated to do a project you can't afford.

Usage of microcontrollers aisre frowned upon in projects that can be done without them. However, some projects listed do require some sort of microcontroller.
